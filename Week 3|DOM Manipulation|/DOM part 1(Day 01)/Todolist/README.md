<h1 style="text-align: center;">Todo List Project</h1>
<p>This document provides an overview of a Todo List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add and remove todo items, with input validation to ensure no invalid entries are added. This project was developed during Week 3, Day [specific day] of my learning journey.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Add Todos:</strong> Users can easily add items to their todo list by entering text and clicking the "Add Todo" button or pressing "Enter".</li>
    <li><strong>Delete Todos:</strong> Items can be removed from the todo list using the "Remove" button, providing a way to manage tasks effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Validation:</strong> The application includes input validation to prevent empty or invalid entries, ensuring that only meaningful todos are added.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Alerts:</strong> A custom alert box is used to notify users when their input is invalid, enhancing user experience and preventing errors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> The project leverages JavaScript to interact with the DOM, allowing dynamic updates to the webpage as users interact with the todo list.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> The application uses event listeners to capture user actions such as clicking buttons or pressing keys, enabling interactive features.</li>
    <li><strong>Styling with CSS:</strong> Custom CSS is used to style the todo list, including transitions, colors, and layout adjustments to improve the visual appeal.</li>
    <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> JavaScript functions are employed to validate user input, ensuring that todos are meaningful and do not contain unwanted characters.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The application layout is designed to be responsive, providing a good user experience across different devices and screen sizes.</li>
</ul>
