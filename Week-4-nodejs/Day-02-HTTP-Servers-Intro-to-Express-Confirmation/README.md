<h1 style="text-align: center;">Day-02 (Express and HTTP Servers)</h1>
<p>This document highlights the work and exercises done on Day-02, focusing on building and managing HTTP servers with Express. The examples demonstrate various HTTP methods, routing, and handling CRUD operations.</p>

<h2>Examples Covered</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Express Server:</strong> Set up a simple Express server and explored various ways to handle routes and responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Student Data Management:</strong> Created endpoints to manage student records including CRUD operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Todo Application:</strong> Developed a filesystem-based todo app with functionalities to add, update, and delete todos.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Express Setup:</strong> Learn how to initialize and configure an Express server.</li>
    <li><strong>Routing and Methods:</strong> Understand how to set up routes and handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).</li>
    <li><strong>CRUD Operations:</strong> Explore creating, reading, updating, and deleting records with RESTful APIs.</li>
    <li><strong>File System Integration:</strong> Practice using the file system to persist data, particularly in the context of a todo application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Explore</h2>
<p>To explore the Express and HTTP server examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li><strong>Examine the Code:</strong> Review the provided JavaScript files to understand how the Express server and routes are implemented.</li>
    <li><strong>Run the Server:</strong> Execute the server scripts in your terminal. Follow the instructions in the code comments for using the different endpoints.</li>
    <li><strong>Test API Endpoints:</strong> Use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints and see the server responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Modify and Experiment:</strong> Make changes to the code or add new features to deepen your understanding of Express and HTTP server management.</li>
</ul>
