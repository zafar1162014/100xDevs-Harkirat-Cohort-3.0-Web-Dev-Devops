<h1 style="text-align: center;">Week 5 Day 1 - Headers, Query Params, and Express</h1>
<p>This document covers various aspects of handling HTTP headers, query parameters, and middleware in Express.js, as well as additional topics such as the Fetch API, differences between Axios and Fetch, and creating an HTTP server.</p>

<h2>Examples Covered</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Handling HTTP Headers:</strong> Demonstrates how to access and manipulate HTTP headers in Express.js to manage requests and responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Query Parameters:</strong> Shows how to work with query parameters in URLs to customize responses based on user input.</li>
    <li><strong>Middleware Introduction:</strong> Provides an introduction to middleware functions in Express.js, including their role in processing requests and responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Request Counting Middleware:</strong> Implements a middleware function to count and limit the number of requests from each IP address.</li>
    <li><strong>Fetch API:</strong> Introduces the Fetch API for making network requests from the client-side.</li>
    <li><strong>Axios vs. Fetch:</strong> Compares Axios and Fetch for making HTTP requests, highlighting their differences and use cases.</li>
    <li><strong>Creating HTTP Server:</strong> Shows how to create a basic HTTP server using Node.js and handle HTTP requests directly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HTTP Headers:</strong> Learn how to access and modify HTTP headers using Express.js to handle request metadata and control responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Query Parameters:</strong> Understand how to retrieve and utilize query parameters to personalize and filter data in web applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Middleware Functions:</strong> Explore the concept of middleware in Express.js, how it processes requests, and how to use it for various tasks like logging and request validation.</li>
    <li><strong>Request Counting and Limiting:</strong> Practice implementing middleware to track and limit the number of requests from individual IP addresses to prevent abuse and manage server load.</li>
    <li><strong>Fetch API:</strong> Understand the Fetch API for making network requests from the browser, including handling responses and errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Axios vs. Fetch:</strong> Learn the differences between Axios and Fetch, including ease of use, error handling, and additional features provided by Axios.</li>
    <li><strong>Creating HTTP Server:</strong> Explore how to set up a basic HTTP server using Node.js, handling incoming requests, and sending responses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignments Done</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Request Logging Middleware:</strong> Created a middleware function to log HTTP method, URL, and timestamp for each incoming request.</li>
    <li><strong>Request Counting Middleware:</strong> Developed middleware to count requests per IP and exposed an endpoint to display the count. Added functionality to block or show a message if more than 5 requests are made.</li>
    <li><strong>Handling Query Parameters:</strong> Implemented routes that process query parameters for addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Fetch API Usage:</strong> Demonstrated how to make network requests using the Fetch API, including handling responses and errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Axios vs. Fetch Comparison:</strong> Compared Axios and Fetch for making HTTP requests, highlighting key differences and when to use each.</li>
    <li><strong>HTTP Server Creation:</strong> Built a basic HTTP server using Node.js to handle and respond to HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Explore</h2>
<p>To explore the Node.js and Express.js examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li><strong>Examine the Code:</strong> Review the provided JavaScript files to understand how HTTP headers, query parameters, middleware, and network requests are handled.</li>
    <li><strong>Run the Examples:</strong> Start the Express server and make requests to the endpoints to see how they handle headers, query parameters, and middleware functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Fetch and Axios:</strong> Test making network requests using both the Fetch API and Axios to understand their usage and differences.</li>
    <li><strong>Create an HTTP Server:</strong> Set up and run a basic HTTP server to see how Node.js handles HTTP requests directly.</li>
    <li><strong>Modify the Code:</strong> Experiment with changing the code or adding new features to deepen your understanding of Express.js, Fetch API, Axios, and HTTP server creation.</li>
</ul>
