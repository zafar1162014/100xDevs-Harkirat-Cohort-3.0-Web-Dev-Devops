<h1 style="text-align: center;">Week 2 Day 2: Advanced JavaScript Concepts</h1>
<p>This document provides an overview of advanced JavaScript concepts, focusing on topics such as async/await, promises, callback hell, user-defined asynchronous functions, inheritance, and classes. Understanding these concepts is essential for creating efficient and maintainable code in modern web applications.</p>

<h2>Concepts Covered</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Async/Await:</strong> Learn how async/await simplifies asynchronous code by making it look and behave like synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.</li>
    <li><strong>Promises:</strong> Understand how promises handle asynchronous operations, allowing for cleaner and more manageable code compared to traditional callbacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Callback Hell:</strong> Explore the challenges of nested callbacks, often referred to as "callback hell," and learn techniques to refactor and manage them effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Defined Async Functions:</strong> Discover how to create and use custom asynchronous functions in JavaScript to handle complex asynchronous workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Inheritance in JavaScript:</strong> Learn about object-oriented programming in JavaScript, specifically how inheritance allows classes to extend other classes, promoting code reuse and organization.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript Classes:</strong> Gain insights into JavaScript classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating data, and defining methods to work on that data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Async/Await:</strong> Asynchronous programming can be simplified using async/await, making the code easier to follow and reducing the risk of errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Promises:</strong> Promises are a more robust way of handling asynchronous operations, avoiding the pitfalls of callback-based code.</li>
    <li><strong>Callback Hell:</strong> Callback hell occurs when callbacks are nested within other callbacks, creating hard-to-read and error-prone code. Refactoring techniques can mitigate this issue.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Defined Async Functions:</strong> Creating custom async functions allows for greater control over asynchronous operations, enabling more complex and efficient workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> JavaScript's prototypal inheritance enables classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes, promoting reuse and organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Classes:</strong> Classes in JavaScript encapsulate data and behavior, making it easier to create and manage complex objects and their interactions.</li>
</ul>
