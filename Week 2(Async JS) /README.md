<h1 style="text-align: center;">Week 2 Day 1: Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>
<p>This document provides an overview of asynchronous JavaScript, focusing on key concepts such as callbacks, functional arguments, and the differences between synchronous and asynchronous code. Understanding these concepts is essential for creating responsive and efficient web applications.</p>

<h2>Concepts Covered</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript:</strong> Learn how non-blocking operations enable JavaScript to handle tasks like I/O operations or timers without halting other code execution.</li>
    <li><strong>Callbacks in JavaScript:</strong> Understand the role of callbacks in handling asynchronous operations and how they allow code to continue running once a task is complete.</li>
    <li><strong>Functional Arguments:</strong> Discover how passing functions as arguments to other functions enhances code flexibility and reusability.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Code:</strong> Explore the differences between synchronous and asynchronous execution, and how asynchronous code allows other tasks to proceed while waiting for operations to complete.</li>
    <li><strong>I/O Heavy Operations:</strong> Learn about handling input/output operations asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Loop and Callbacks:</strong> Gain insights into how the event loop manages asynchronous operations and executes callbacks once the main thread is free.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript:</strong> Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to perform tasks without blocking other code. This is crucial for creating responsive applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Callbacks:</strong> Functions passed as arguments to other functions, executed after a task completes. They handle asynchronous operations effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Functional Arguments:</strong> Passing functions as arguments to other functions allows for flexible and reusable code implementations.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Code:</strong> Synchronous code executes line by line, while asynchronous code allows tasks to run independently, enhancing efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>I/O Operations:</strong> Input/output operations can be handled asynchronously to prevent blocking the main thread, improving performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Loop:</strong> Manages asynchronous operations by ensuring that callbacks are executed once the main thread is available.</li>
</ul>
